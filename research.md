#### Full general relativistic galaxy angular power spectrum

The modern understanding of physical cosmology incorporates an inflationary epoch just after the Big Bang, in which the universe expanded by many orders of magnitude. During this period of inflation, quantum fluctuations grew in size to macroscopic scales and became the seeds for all structure in the universe. The exact statistical composition of these so-called *primordial density perturbations* is an open question in physical cosmology, the answer to which can provide significant insight into the exact nature of inflation. 

From observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we know that these primordial fluctuations are *nearly* Gaussian, but even the smallest deviations from Gaussianity can have important implications. Therefore, the deviation from Gaussianity of the large-scale gravitational potential is typically expanded via
\\[\Phi(\boldsymbol x) = \Phi_G(\boldsymbol x) + f_{\mathrm{NL}} \left[\Phi_G^2(\boldsymbol x) - \left<\Phi_G \right>^2 \right] + \ldots \\]
In other words, statistically significant measurements of this \\(f_{\mathrm{NL}}\\) term could act as a ``smoking-gun" signal for inflation and help distinguish between different models of inflation.
